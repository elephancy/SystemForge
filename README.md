# SystemForge

SystemForge is a deterministic distributed-systems laboratory. Architectures can run entirely in the browser, while the production control plane accepts bounded canonical runs for durable sharing and comparison.

## Product modes

- **Guided** scenarios disclose their requirements and teach a specific systems problem.
- **Custom** scenarios let authors define workloads, incidents, requirements, and shareable challenges.
- **Interview** scenarios separate the interviewer brief and hidden evaluation criteria from the candidate's editable derived requirements, with enforced never, after-first-run, and interviewer-controlled reveal policies for canonical sessions.

The local simulator is intentionally independent from the API. If the service is overloaded or unavailable, the installed application keeps editing and running locally while canonical submission and server-backed sharing are disabled.
The canonical control plane separately bounds request concurrency, queued runs,
durable records, stored short links, input size, serialized result size, and
modeled work. Canonical architecture solving adds a separately bounded worker
thread and falls back to the browser-local solver when server capacity is not
available, so server pressure cannot remove the local workflow.
The static shell is isolated from API capacity, cached by the service worker for
returning browsers, and carries a separate Cloudflare stale-on-error policy so
canonical overload does not turn into a blank product surface.

SystemForge also has an optional, server-side AI assistance layer. When an
operator explicitly enables and configures it, the Scenario Editor can turn a
written brief into a validated preview, the Report tab can explain a completed
canonical run using exact server-supplied evidence, and the Interview room can
draft candidate-visible discovery questions. AI output never runs the simulator,
never supplies modeled measurements, and never changes a draft until the user
applies a proposal that passes the ordinary contracts. The feature is disabled
by default; the local editor, simulator, solver, and replay workflow do not
depend on it. Submitted text leaves SystemForge for the configured provider, and
retention depends on that provider account's data controls.
The production provider is Cloudflare Workers AI through a dedicated AI
Gateway. Admission is globally limited to 50 calls per UTC day and 500 calls per
UTC month, with stricter per-client route limits and one provider request in
flight at a time. Every admitted call also records a conservative five-cent
audit reservation. The separate Gateway blocking limit is configured at $5.00
per sliding month with no fallback; it is the operator-approved provider-spend
budget.

## Local development and deterministic demo

Use Node.js 24 or newer and pnpm 11.16.0. From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

The Vite URL printed by `pnpm dev` is the complete local-first product. Open
`/lab` and choose **Run locally**; an API, account, database, or network
connection is not required for the modeled run. `pnpm dev:api` and
`pnpm dev:worker` are separate canonical-service development commands and are
not prerequisites for the browser-local workflow.

For a repeatable presenter reset, open **Compare**, select **Scenarios**, and
load **Black Friday Checkout**. That restores the versioned example scenario
and architecture through the same validated store actions used by ordinary
editing. Then:

- start the local run and pause after the first delivered frames;
- select a component, schedule one future intervention or outage, and resume;
- inspect the linked events, sampled request spans, resource histories, and
  objective results in **Investigate**;
- open **Runs** to star a reference, compare exact modeled deltas, inspect the
  compatible trend, and verify or export a retained replay; use **Compare** for
  architecture alternatives and **Report** for the current run evidence.

The same validated inputs, engine version, seed, and action schedule reproduce
the same modeled result. This is deterministic model evidence, not a production
benchmark or captured service telemetry.

The Decision Workbench's **Field guide** keeps 21 disclosed production-system
snapshots and 52 primary-source incident records searchable beside the modeled
work. Architecture diagrams show only disclosed component paths and label their
time scope; incident views keep cited historical facts separate from
SystemForge's prevention deductions.

The **Calibrate** workbench can retain and replay bounded CSV or JSON traffic
observations, attach versioned provider-catalog inputs, and fit one component's
capacity and base latency against timestamped CPU and latency telemetry. Node
fits use a deterministic holdout gate and remain rejected unless held-out error
improves without a material regression. Accepted inputs retain their provenance
on the architecture; they remain model calibration evidence, not a production
benchmark or automatic infrastructure recommendation.

Run the repository gate with:

```sh
pnpm quality
```

If a saved browser draft is rejected after a schema change, SystemForge fails
closed to the example workspace. To reset manually without clearing unrelated
site data, remove only `systemforge:draft` from local storage and
`systemforge:interviewer-draft` plus `systemforge:session` from session storage,
then reload `/lab`. A previously warmed production build can reload the local
Lab while offline; server runs, collaboration, reveal synchronization, and
short-link creation remain unavailable until the online service recovers.

For a hard presenter reset, run this app-scoped command in the browser console:

```js
localStorage.removeItem("systemforge:draft");
localStorage.removeItem("systemforge:architecture-snapshots");
localStorage.removeItem("systemforge:density");
indexedDB.deleteDatabase("systemforge-run-history");
sessionStorage.removeItem("systemforge:interviewer-draft");
sessionStorage.removeItem("systemforge:session");
location.replace("/lab");
```

## Production status

The restricted release controller selects an exact successful, unsuperseded
`main` CI run and consumes its tested, checksummed image artifact. Public
workflows build and verify the application and monitor public health; they do
not request deployment identities or publish production releases. The controller
owns immutable image promotion, backup, restore, acceptance, and rollback. No
host credential or direct-host procedure belongs in this repository. The boundary
is documented in `docs/operations/production.md`, with current public evidence
limits in `docs/release-readiness.md`.

## Workspace

- `apps/web` — React/Vite workspace and offline-capable local simulator.
- `apps/api` — Fastify control plane and overload-safe submission API.
- `apps/worker` — bounded canonical simulation worker.
- `packages/contracts` — versioned architecture, scenario, run, and error contracts.
- `packages/sim-core` — deterministic simulation, requirement evaluation, and
  bounded architecture alternative solving.
- `deploy` — application image, local integration, and production-profile files.

The engine and solver contract, supported trade-offs, verification paths, and
honest model limits are documented in [`docs/engine.md`](docs/engine.md).

Commands are run from the repository root with pnpm. See `docs/operations/production.md` before changing production.
